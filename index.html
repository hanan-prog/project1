          The video below shows the completed project with all required features
          implemented. Additional videos further down demonstrate each feature
          individually. One challenge I encountered was calculating the rotation
          angle so that the square rotated in the direction the mouse was being
          dragged; this was the feature that took me the longest to implement.
          Brightening the image also took some time because the scalar I
          initially added to each pixel was too high, which distorted the image.
          I eventually realized (after talking about it in class) I needed to clamp the values between 0 and 255.
